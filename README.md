# @lvindotex/pico

This is my tiny react clone i built in order to get a better understanding of Reactjs. its based of https://pomb.us/build-your-own-react/.
I plan to publish this to npm when im done with it, and suffer a lot since i want to make this fully typed with Typescript ;-;. watch this space.

# TODO

- useEffect is really slow
- useReducer and useContext
- maybe a statemanager like zustand
